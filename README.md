# TigerBelly
This is a 2-line bash script which plays any episode of tigerbelly you request. Have to have mvp for it to work though. 
The script pulls the link of the episode from the txt file urls.txt which contains all the links to all the episodes on YouTube. 
When running the script, only write the number of the episode itself. I will be updating the txt file weekly with new episodes coming out.
