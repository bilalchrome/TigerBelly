# TigerBelly

This is a 2-line bash script which plays any episode of TigerBelly you request.

The script pulls the link of the episode from **urls.txt** file which contains all the links to all the episodes on YouTube. 

When running the script, only write the number of the episode itself. I will be updating the txt file weekly with new episodes coming out. 

**Make sure the txt file and the script are in the same directory, otherwise you will have to specifiy that in the script**
